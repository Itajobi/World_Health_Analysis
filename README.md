# Health Dashboard Analysis
This interactive dashboard provides a multi-dimensional analysis of global and regional health challenges using publicly available health-related datasets. The project offers insights into disease burden, trends in alcohol use disorders, HIV/AIDS distribution, and the impact of violence and terrorism-related deaths on public health.

# Dashboard Insights

# Key Highlights

* Total Disorder Cases: 96.4 million
* Total Violence-Related Cases: 16.94 million
* Deaths from Terrorism: 294,640
* Total Disease Burden (1990–2019): Over 1.17 billion cases globally

# Disease Trends (1990–2019)

* Yearly increases observed in total disease burden, with the highest recorded in 2007.
* Top diseases visualized by entity and year, showcasing disparities across countries and regions.
* Tuberculosis is highlighted with geographic markers using a map visualization.

# Alcohol Use Disorders

* A line chart reveals steady growth in alcohol use disorders globally from 1990 to the early 2010s, with a peak around 2014 before a drop.

# HIV/AIDS by Country Code

* Distribution shows high prevalence in countries like LBY (Libya) and WSM (Samoa), followed by others.
* Coded visualization offers a snapshot of HIV/AIDS case disparities across nations.

# Malaria Filters

* The dashboard includes slicers for malaria data, allowing users to explore how malaria metrics correlate with other health indicators.

# Tools Used

* Microsoft Power BI
* Geographic data: Microsoft Bing Maps
* Health metrics compiled from publicly available global datasets

# Objective

To create a compelling visual summary of health burdens across countries, drawing attention to critical public health issues like infectious diseases, non-communicable conditions, and the secondary effects of violence and terrorism.
